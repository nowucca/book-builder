## Recent Decisions

### Decision 1: Minted + UV for Syntax Highlighting
**Date**: December 28, 2024
**Context**: Code blocks in callouts were overflowing margins, needed line breaking with syntax highlighting

**Decision**: Use Minted package with Python/Pygments, managed via uv

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Listings package: Supports breaklines but inferior syntax highlighting
- Manual line breaks: Too much maintenance burden
- Smaller fonts only: Insufficient for longest lines

**Implementation**:
- Python dependencies isolated to book-builder/.venv via uv
- Custom Lua filter (minted-filter.lua) converts code blocks to Minted
- LaTeX templates configured with breaklines, hook arrow continuation
- Build script passes --shell-escape and extends PATH to .venv/bin
- Code callouts get reduced horizontal margins (0.5em) for more space

**Rationale**:
- Minted provides best-in-class syntax highlighting via Pygments
- Automatic line breaking with customizable continuation indicators
- UV keeps Python ecosystem isolated and fast
- Reusable pattern for future book projects

**Result**: Professional code rendering with automatic wrapping

### Decision 2: Digital vs Print Callout Styling
**Date**: December 28, 2024
**Context**: User wanted modern left-bar callouts for digital PDF but traditional complete boxes for print

**Decision**: Separate callout filters for digital and print formats

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single style for both: User specifically wanted different styles
- New dialect (digital/modern, digital/traditional): Overcomplicating, just optimize existing formats
- Manual switching: Too error-prone, config-driven is better

**Implementation**:
- Created `callout-filter-digital.lua` with left-bar style (`frame hidden` + `borderline west`)
- Created `callout-filter-print.lua` with complete box style (`colframe`)
- Created separate Pandoc defaults files: `pandoc-defaults-digital.yaml` and `pandoc-defaults-print.yaml`
- Updated `book.config.js` to specify `defaultsFile` per output target
- Updated `build-book.js` to use target-specific defaults when specified
- Digital gets reduced margins for more content width

**Rationale**:
- Digital PDFs benefit from modern, space-efficient design
- Print PDFs benefit from traditional, clearly-defined boxes
- Same config system supports both without code duplication
- Users can choose which format to build independently

**Result**: Clean separation, both builds working, modern digital look with traditional print reliability

### Decision 3: Rounded Corners with Curved Left Bar for Digital
**Date**: December 29, 2024
**Context**: Digital callouts needed polished, professional appearance with rounded corners

**Decision**: Rounded box corners with custom TikZ path for curved left bar

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Sharp corners: Too harsh, not modern enough
- `borderline west` with rounded corners: Creates rendering artifacts, bar doesn't follow curves
- Rounded corners on bar itself: Made all edges round, looked wrong
- Complex swooped designs: Too complicated, rendering issues

**Implementation**:
- Box with 3pt rounded corners (`rounded corners, arc=3pt`)
- Custom TikZ overlay path with arc[] commands
- Left bar follows box's top-left and bottom-left corner curves exactly
- Right side of bar remains straight (4pt wide)
- Uses `frame` coordinates to cover both title and content
- Matching light colored backgrounds throughout
- Bold black title text

**Rationale**:
- Rounded corners provide modern, polished appearance
- Curved bar integration eliminates visual discontinuities
- Precise TikZ paths ensure perfect alignment
- Matches professional design standards

**Result**: Beautiful rounded callouts with seamless corner integration, professional appearance

### Decision 4: Node Modules Exclusion Strategy
**Date**: December 25, 2024
**Context**: Emoji validation was scanning node_modules causing false positives

**Decision**: Multi-layered exclusion approach in validate-emojis.js

**Implementation**:
- Enhanced glob ignore patterns with comprehensive list
- Added explicit shouldProcessFile() checks
- Multiple pattern variations for reliability
- Excludes: node_modules, book-backup, build, dist, .git

**Rationale**:
- Single layer (glob ignore) insufficient in some contexts
- Defense-in-depth ensures reliability across environments
- Prevents validation of dependency code
- Maintains integrity for actual content validation

**Result**: Validation correctly processes 23 book files, 0 violations

### Decision 2: Submodule Path Resolution Strategy
**Date**: December 28, 2024
**Context**: After repo separation, hardcoded "tools/" paths broke builds

**Decision**: Use __dirname-based path resolution in build scripts

**Implementation**:
- Changed `toolsDir = path.resolve(rootDir, "tools")`
- To: `toolsDir = path.resolve(__dirname, "..")`
- Updated all config files to use "book-builder/" prefix
- LaTeX templates use relative paths: `./book-builder/fonts/`

**Rationale**:
- Makes book-builder work from any location
- Doesn't depend on parent directory structure
- Enables true standalone usage as submodule
- Scripts always find their own resources

**Result**: All builds working correctly from submodule location

### Decision 3: Font Format Requirements
**Date**: December 28, 2024
**Context**: XeLaTeX requires TTF/OTF fonts, WOFF2 doesn't work

**Decision**: Include all TTF fonts, gitignore only >100MB files

**Implementation**:
- Copied 29 TTF fonts from book-backup (48-68K each)
- Included NotoColorEmoji.ttf (9.7M)
- Gitignored AppleColorEmoji.ttf (180M)
- LaTeX templates reference TTF files directly

**Rationale**:
- XeLaTeX fontspec package requires TTF/OTF format
- WOFF2 only for web, not usable for PDF generation
- Small fonts (<10M) acceptable in repo for self-containment
- Very large fonts (>100M) excluded via gitignore

**Result**: PDF builds successfully with all required fonts

### Decision 4: Metadata Consistency
**Date**: December 28, 2024
**Context**: metadata.yaml had old appendix names after Phase 3 cleanup

**Decision**: Update metadata to reflect actual book structure

**Implementation**:
- Changed appendices to: "Constellize Method Summary", "A Manifesto for Constellize"
- Added online_resources section with 5 website URLs
- Removed references to deleted appendices (A, D, E, F, G)

**Rationale**:
- Metadata should accurately describe book contents
- Online resources documented for reference
- Consistency between code and metadata prevents confusion

**Result**: Metadata matches actual book structure

## Active Patterns

### Build System Design
- **Script Organization**: Separate scripts for each concern (build, validate, process)
- **Configuration**: External metadata.yaml keeps code generic
- **Validation**: Run before builds to catch issues early
- **Error Handling**: Clear messages guide users to solutions

### Git Workflow
- **Standalone First**: Make changes in standalone repo
- **Push to GitHub**: Central source of truth
- **Submodule Pull**: Users update via git pull in submodule
- **Semantic Versioning**: Major.minor.patch for releases

### Quality Standards
- **Validation Before Build**: Catch issues early
- **Multi-layered Checks**: Don't rely on single mechanism
- **Clear Error Messages**: Help users fix issues
- **Documentation**: Examples and troubleshooting guides

## Important Learnings

### Learning 1: Glob Ignore Patterns Not Sufficient
**Discovered**: December 25, 2024
**Issue**: glob ignore patterns alone didn't always exclude node_modules
**Solution**: Added explicit path checking as safety layer
**Application**: Always use defense-in-depth for critical exclusions

### Learning 2: Git Submodule Workflow
**Context**: Book-builder used as submodule in book project
**Insight**: Edit standalone repo, push, then pull in submodule
**Benefit**: Maintains proper git relationships, avoids confusion
**Application**: Document this workflow clearly for users

### Learning 3: Font Inclusion Worth the Size
**Context**: Including ~10MB of fonts in repo
**Value**: Makes system self-contained, easier for users
**Trade-off**: Larger repo size acceptable for convenience
**Application**: Self-contained trumps minimal repo size

### Learning 4: XeLaTeX Font Format Requirements
**Discovered**: December 28, 2024
**Issue**: XeLaTeX requires TTF/OTF fonts, not WOFF2
**Solution**: Include TTF fonts in repo, gitignore only >100MB files
**Application**: Font format matters - web fonts (WOFF2) don't work for PDF
**Insight**: Self-contained with proper formats better than minimal repo

### Learning 5: Submodule Independence Requires Dynamic Paths
**Discovered**: December 28, 2024
**Issue**: Hardcoded "tools/" paths broke after submodule extraction
**Solution**: Use __dirname for path resolution relative to script location
**Application**: Scripts should find resources relative to themselves
**Insight**: True reusability requires eliminating assumptions about parent structure
